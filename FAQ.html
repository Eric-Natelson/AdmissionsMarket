                            <h2 style="color:black">HOW POPULAR ARE ADMISSIONS CONSULTANTS?</h2>
                            <p style="color:grey">Since most people don’t publicize their use of admissions consultants, it can be hard to get an exact number. Still AdmissionsMarket’s own survey of nearly 250 students from top MBA programs found that 49% had used an admissions consultant, of which 64% used a three, four, or five school package. These numbers are generally in line with a similar survey conducted by the Association of International Graduate Admissions Consultants (AIGAC), which found that 46% had used an admissions consultants. Some reports state lower percentages, the Graduate Management Admissions Council (GMAC) found that only 22% had used one. All in all, it’s a safe bet that between a quarter and half of students use admissions consultants to get into business school and that this number trends upward the more competitive the school.</p>

                          <h2 style="color:black">HOW DO SCHOOLS FEEL ABOUT ADMISSIONS CONSULTANTS?</h2>
                          <p style="color:grey">Universities have increasingly begun to work with qualified admissions consultants to ensure applicants are as prepared as possible. If friction exists between business schools and consultants, it is primarily due to the unregulated nature of the industry and the many unqualified consultants peddling bad advice in exchange for high fees. Schools understand and accept that many applicants are going to use a consultant; they just ask that you choose someone that will ethically guide you along the application process. At AdmissionsMarket, we work exclusively with top ethical consultants.</p><p style="color:grey">To read about how the admissions team at the Tuck School of Business (Dartmouth) view consultants, click here.</p>

                          <h2 style="color:black">HOW FAR IN ADVANCE SHOULD I USE AN ADMISSIONS CONSULTANT?</h2>
                          <p style="color:grey">Applicants use admissions consultants in a variety of ways, from unlimited consulting hours for every business school to which they’re applying to an hourly service to get a quick sanity check. According to AIGAC, 68% of clients that use a consultant did so six months or fewer before the application deadline. Overall, you should be realistic about how much time you have to dedicate to your applications a week and understand that a consultant can’t (and shouldn’t) do the work for you. Given our experience we believe in most cases you’ll need four to six months to make the most of a school package but are happy to work with you no matter your needs.</p>

                          <h2 style="color:black">HOW MUCH DOES ADMISSIONS CONSULTING COST?</h2>
                          <p style="color:grey">The cost of consulting varies depending on the package you purchase and the country you live in. In the United States, hourly rates are generally between $150 and $400 and a four school package costs ~$9,000. Given the financial investment–and the even greater stakes–it is important that you choose a consultant that is not only qualified but a good fit for you personally.</p>

                          <p style="color:grey">The primary goal of AdmissionsMarket is to help you find the best possible consultant. However, we understand that price is a critical consideration for many applicants, and our role as a concierge service allows us a certain level of market power and ability to bundle multiple applicants in exchange for preferred pricing not available to the general public. If this is of interest to you, please reach out and your personal concierge will explain how the opportunity works in further detail.Furthermore, special pricing options exist if you are applying more than six months before your application deadline and are flexible on the consultant you work with. Under these circumstances we let you name your price and minimum standards and if you commit to it, we’ll work with our network of consultants to see who has capacity and is willing to take you on as a client at the given rate.</p>

                          <p style="color:grey">While anyone that has applied to business school understands the pressure the admissions process puts you through, you shouldn’t forget that your incredible accomplishments thus far are what have you in the running to begin with. If admissions consulting truly isn’t an option for you, try and spend additional time researching the admissions process, speaking with students (LinkedIn is a great resource if you don’t know anyone), and reflecting on your career. Start early and ask your friends and family to review your essays. If you’re African-American, Hispanic, or American Indian, you should also consider applying to Management Leadership for Tomorrow, a fantastic not-for-profit organization that helps diverse candidates get into top business programs.</p>

                          <h2 style="color:black">WHY SHOULD I USE ADMISSIONSMARKET?</h2>
                          <p style="color:grey">Getting into a top business school is important—not just because of the upfront costs but the opportunity cost of missing your chance of getting into a better school. If you sell yourself short on where you’re admitted, you will be giving up (on average) hundreds of thousands of dollars in combined career pay & bonus. Choosing the right admissions consultant can help ensure you get into the best school possible. Unfortunately, there’s a lot of information out there but very little transparency. That’s why we did all the research so we could walk you through who’s for real and who’s not. Better yet, we do the work for free and provide five hours of pro bono consulting for every package purchased through our site.</p>

                          <p>Yes. We can provide detailed information and introductions to any company. Still, just because you’ve picked out the company doesn’t mean your work is done. Companies like Stacy Blackman and Veritas Prep have 50 or more consultants, all of whom have very different qualifications. AdmissionsMarket will help you determine the best fit for you, free of charge.</p>

We believe that in this highly competitive world people should use the resources at their disposal to get ahead. However we’re also aware that many can’t afford a consultant and want to make sure highly-qualified candidates without the same financial resources still get a chance to shine and be competitive at top schools. If you or someone you care about is a first-generation college applicant, coming from an underrepresented minority background, or you feel may qualify for pro bono consulting for other reasons, please reach out to impact@admissionsmarket.com.</p>
