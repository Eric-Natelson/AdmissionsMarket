You may have noticed that there are a lot of recent MBA alums making their way into admissions consulting. Often these MBA’s have full-time jobs and use consulting to make additional income on the side – but, how good are they? Let’s dive into the strengths and weaknesses of young, part-time consultants and what you should be aware of before you sign with them. 

Part-time consultants have significant industry and school expertise...

There can be considerable benefits to working with a part-time consultant when the person has a similar background and/or path to yours. Moreover, if your dream is to attend a specific school, working with an alum can help you leverage an accurate and detailed understanding of school culture. Cultures change rapidly within schools and many full-time consultants have trouble matching the level of expertise held by a recent alum. This means that when helping you craft your essays in a way that resonates, they may be passing along outdated information that will have your application readers wondering if you even bothered to visit campus and speak to the student body.

...but be sure they’re working for a top firm, or offering discounted services if not

When you work with well versed, full-time consultants you get their years of experience of having worked with hundreds of applicants. Some have built direct relationships with current and former admissions officers that allow them a better understanding of what schools are looking for and may even attend annual conferences on the state of the industry.
The only way that a part-time consultant will be able to provide that amount of value is if they are working with a firm that heavily invests in training. Big-box firms use their significant resources to hire a supporting cast that can help supplement the MBA skill set with admissions and writing expertise. Firm resources are also important because they leverage their significant experience to create a structured process that helps you effectively and efficiently attack your application.
