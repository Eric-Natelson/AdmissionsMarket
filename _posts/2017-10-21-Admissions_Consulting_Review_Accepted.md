### **Overview**
Accepted was founded in 1994 and is one of the oldest firms in the industry and offers consulting for undergraduate, medical, law and other graduate programs in addition to MBA programs.  Nearly half of the 13 MBA consultants featured on the website have been with Accepted for greater than seven years while the other half were hired within the last one to two years.  It is one of the few major firms that often uses discounting to incentivize new business and may be a good fit for a candidate looking for a reputable firm but on a tight budget.

### **Hiring and Consultant Training**
The founder oversees the hiring process and candidates are asked to review a sample business school essay and edit another so they can be evaluated on their writing skills. Most of the consultants hired have former admissions experience, whether as MBAs, admissions officers, or writers/consultants, so onboarding is mostly confined to teaching the firm’s administrative processes.  Consultants mention that information is shared openly and regularly amongst the team so they stay abreast of new admissions insights. 

### **Consulting Process**

Candidates work exclusively with one of their 13 MBA admissions consultants throughout the entire application process.  They are a mixture of full-time and part-time consultants with the latter primarily holding side jobs in teaching or writing. As it’s a small team the consultants regularly consult one another for feedback on applications and provide school-specific support based on their expertise. The founder is also very involved in application reviews and will frequently weighs in during the review process and before an application is submitted.  

It is up to the discretion of the consultant how many clients they take on each admissions cycle. A full-time consultant will typically work with up to six clients for round one and the same for round two.  With package clients, they setup regular standing calls and meetings with them, which increase as deadlines approach. With hourly clients, calls are setup based on an individual’s needs. 

### **Consultant Selection**

You may choose a specific consultant with whom to work or you can let Accepted assign you to a consultant based on a brief online questionnaire you complete. The firm claims they put a lot of thought into the matchmaking process though it is unclear what process is used.

### **Our 30-Minute free consultation experience**

• Following a brief online questionnaire, a client services rep emailed me the same day with the name, email, and number of the consultant with whom I had been matched. No background was provided on the consultant, and the onus was on me to email the consultant to setup the call. 

• Consultant began asking why I wanted to apply to business school but other than that there seemed to be limited structure to the conversation – it was up to me to drive it.

• Consultant was not particularly forthright with the questions I had about the firm and seemed somewhat guarded. 

• Same-day follow-up by consultant with links to their two different services: à la carte and comprehensive application package. Offer of an end of month discount if I purchased now. She shared links to two resources on their website:

• Link to downloadable [MBA Admissions Guides](https://www.accepted.com/mba-special-reports) from the pre-application planning phase to specific guides addressing tips during the application process

• Link to [B-School Zones](https://www.accepted.com/mba/zones/bschools), which includes aggregated school-specific information for over 30 schools

### **What a former Accepted consultant says about the firm**
“The firm places a great deal of emphasis on good writing, more so than many of the other admissions consulting firms that I’ve worked with.  At Accepted, teamwork is heavily emphasized with fellow consultants reviewing each other’s work on a monthly basis; consultants regularly use one another for school-specific expertise. “

This quoted consultant stayed with the firm for several years because s(he) liked Accepted’s emphasis on writing and teamwork. However, the consultant ultimately decided to leave once own knowledge and client base was established to start his/her own business. One critique is that Accepted’s leadership became too narrowly focused on profit, which in the consultant’s opinion eroded the company culture over time.  

On a scale of 1-10 with 1 being least likely, consultant gave a 7-8 overall that would recommend Accepted’s consulting services to a friend. Consultant commented that there are still some good consultants at the firm but felt like many of the top consultants left given some of the changes in company culture.  To a prospective consultant, he/she only gave a 3-4 that would recommend working at Accepted.

### **Points of Pride**

• Consultants hired are either experienced writers/editors or consultants

• Informal peer review program where ~10% of all drafts are reviewed by another consultant or the founder herself

• Drafts are guaranteed to be returned within two business days

• Ethical based consulting — Accepted’s founder is also the co-founder of the Association of International Graduate Admissions Consultants (AIGAC) that seeks to define ethical standards in the industry
