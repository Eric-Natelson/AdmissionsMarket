### **Overview**
mbaMission has the feel of a boutique consulting firm and the resources of an industry leader. Founded nearly 20 years ago, mbaMission prides itself on hiring only full-time consultants with significant writing and admissions consulting. 

### **Hiring and Consultant Training**
The company only hires consultants with extensive writing and editing backgrounds (i.e. are published) and the interview process involves a writing test to measure their skills. Company boasts that only 29% of those who apply meet their hiring standards. Training includes an onboarding process and weekly all-hands meetings to discuss current trends and changes in the industry.  The firm also uniquely gathers the entire company for an annual three-day conference to gain insights directly from current admissions officers. 

### **Consulting Process**
You will work 1:1 with one of their 24 full-time senior consultants from start to finish.  The consultant who you select will be with you throughout the entire application process. While some firms use a second pair of eyes to make revisions and/or serve as copy editors, mbaMission feels that you’re best served by having one person manage and execute the entire process. 

The typical starting process when working with mbaMission is to complete a brainstorming document. The detailed questionnaire covers your history from childhood to professional accomplishments. Although lengthy in nature, the exercise serves to tease out life stories that can be synthesized into a central theme for your essays. Many clients attribute the process to vastly improving their essay writing and in turn, the consultant is better able to identify the uniqueness of your candidacy so it can be highlighted throughout your application.  

### **Consultant Selection**
Who you work with is entirely up to you.  The company’s full roster of 24 senior consultants is listed online with bios and lengthy client testimonials. Unique to mbaMission is that each consultant’s page also contains intro videos of them sharing helpful info on their backgrounds and unique admissions insights.  Unfortunately you can request a consultation with someone that is unavailable, and they will accept the call without informing you of this fact in order to later steer you to another candidate. Given this, we suggest reaching out and asking specifically if they would be available to take on new clients prior to accepting the call.
