AdmissionsMarket surveyed 234 MBA students on their experience with admissions consultants. We wanted to attain objective, unbiased information regarding the prevalence of and opinions toward admissions consulting.

Respondents were either recent alumni or currently enrolled in a top 20-business school, with the majority of students coming from Wharton, Haas, Columbia, Cornell, and Booth.

Overall, we found that:
1. 51% of respondents hired an admissions consultant during the application process.
2. Over 50% paid for a 3+ school comprehensive package.
3. Nearly 36% of students who worked with an admissions consultant said that looking back they may have chosen a different consultant or package.

AdmissionsMarket connects MBA applicants to the best MBA Admissions consultant for them. We started the service after having a frustrating experience searching for an admissions consulting service on our own and not knowing who to trust with such an important decision.

We offer our services free of charge and any package purchased through our site provides five free hours of admissions consulting to a college applicant in needâ€Š. Contact us today at www.admissionsmarket.com to learn more.
