Many people feel that big-box consultants are automatically the best option, after all they have 
sophisticated websites, long client lists, and significant amounts of resources. The reality, however, is 
that the admissions consulting business model used by many big-box firms can create seriously 
misaligned financial incentives that can have strong and often unintended consequences.  
 
 
**Your admissions consultant may only be getting a small percentage of the package price…** 

Most large consulting firms don’t hire full-time consultants, instead, they operate under an independent 
contractor model in which consultants get paid set rates for specific school packages. These rates are 
often between ~20% and ~40% of the overall price of the package. This means that if you pay $4,000 
for one school package, your consultant may be receiving as little as $800 of this amount despite doing 
the majority of the work.  In these situations, the incentive is clear. Many top consultants that are able 
to build continuous, referral-based business choose to open their own shop so as to stop giving away 
~70% of their revenue unnecessarily.  
This is not to say that big-box consulting firms don’t have (and keep) quality consultants. They hire top 
talent (MBA’s, published authors, certified coaches) and invest significant resources in training them, 
and implementing controls and processes to ensure you have a fantastic experience. While some may 
leave over time, others like that the firm allows them to focus 100% of their time helping clients rather 
than running a business.  
 
Still, the reality remains that big-box consultants don’t have a monopoly on talent, they just have a 
(near) monopoly on an applicant’s current ability to find it. 
 
 
**Package deals can be good for you, but may decrease a consultants’ hourly wages…**
 
Getting paid a small, fixed, portion of the overall package price (e.g., $800) means that as the amount 
of hours spent on your application goes up, the consultant’s “hourly wage” goes down. This creates a clear 
incentive for consultants to try to cap the amount of hours they spend with 
you by pushing you to be “done” before your application has reached its true potential. 
 
While boutique consultants are not immune to this incentive, they often work for themselves (or at least 
receive a much higher portion of the package price) and thus their hourly wages remain respectable 
even where there is an unexpected increase in hours spent with you.  
 
Understanding this dynamic and how it might affect you is important. If you are someone that craves 
efficiency and structure above all else, you’re unlikely to go so far above the average number of hours 
that this will ever affect you. If, however, you like to talk through your questions and problems 
(particularly on the phone) and don’t have a firm understanding of the MBA process already, then you 
might be interested in a boutique consultant more willing to spend additional time with you. 

**Financial incentives are an important indicator, but not the end all be-all…** 

The above discussion can help you understand incentives, but does not account for a consultant’s love 
of mentorship, number of clients, experience, and many other variables that can also impact their 
performance.  Ask smart questions and do your research to make sure you get the right fit for you.
