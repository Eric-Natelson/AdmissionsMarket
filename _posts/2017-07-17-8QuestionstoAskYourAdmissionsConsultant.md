Many admissions consultants will offer you a 30 minute free consultation. Typically, applicants will use this time to get a better understanding of their profile and how a consultant can help. However, if you’re serious about hiring someone this shouldn’t be your priority. Prioritize getting a feel for who they are and what they can offer that’s differentiated from other consultants. There will be plenty of time to talk about making you a better applicant if and when you choose to sign with them.


Here are 8 questions to make the most of your time:

1. What do you personally feel makes you a good coach?
   This is a great starter question, asking the consultant to identify their own strengths as it pertains to coaching and mentorship, rather than general professional practices. If you’re speaking with more than one coach, feel out how unique or generic these responses feel – are they tailored to you? Does s(he) have a clear and structured process?

2. Can you talk to me about the consulting process at your firm? What sets it apart from the industry?
   Your consultant is just part of the package – many firms offer resources that go above and beyond what a single person could offer. Methods vary across consultants and consulting firms, and you should dig deep on this question to understand the intricacies of how the firms vary.

3. Do you work independently or with a team of writers? If with a team, what do you specifically do versus the team?
   Larger firms often have editors that help fine-tune your writing and catch grammar mistakes. However, the quality and consistency of their work can vary dramatically. Some have Master's degrees and are published writers, others have limited qualifications and no experience with MBA programs. Some firms may send your work to the same editors each time, while others rotate writers out which could affect the flow and consistency of your writing. There are pros and cons to using an editing team and you should understand them prior to choosing a firm.

4. How many clients do you currently have and/or expect to take this round?
   This will give you a good idea of how many accounts your consultant will be juggling and what your accessibility to them may look like. Particularly if they’re part-time at the firm, be wary of consultants that work with more than a couple of applicants at a time.

5. How often do you usually communicate with your clients and how? Do you limit this in any way?
   Be clear on communication and how often you expect to hear from your consultant. This way if you decide to work together you can hold them accountable to the agreed upon standards. Many firms will guarantee 24 hour response times, while others will only guarantee 72 hours. The reality is that both can be OK, but you should set your expectations early in the process and be comfortable with what you’re getting.

6. What type of working cadence can I expect? (In general can you take calls on short notice? Do you work     weekends and/or are you willing to take calls after 8pm?)
   Be clear on what type of access you expect to have to your consultant, and ask what their ground rules are on hours of operation. If you’re mostly working on your applications in the evenings after a workday and expect your consultant to be available to you, a consultant who strictly works 9-5 may not be the best fit.

7. How do you keep up with new trends, academic changes and evolving campus cultures?
   MBA programs are constantly evolving, making sure you’re working with someone who is up to date is crucial. Some firms may host guest speakers, arrange weekly or monthly team meetings, take part in campus visits, and even attend annual conferences. Working with someone who is invested in their own career development is critical to making sure they don’t try to typecast you into “tried and true” templated applications that are sure to get you rejected.

8. If part-time: How do you manage your full-time workload with admissions consulting?
   Many great admissions consultants do so on a part-time basis, and if that’s the case chances are they’ve graduated from a top MBA program and have a demanding full-time job. This is fine so long as they’ve shown a track record of managing their commitments. You should be confident that they’re as committed to your application as you are, and won’t leave you hanging when it matters most.
