### **Overview**
Stacy Blackman Consulting (SBC) launched in 2001 when its namesake Kellogg grad sought to launch a business that would provide assistance to MBA applicants as one of the first in its field.  Today SBC is possibly the largest admissions consulting firms in the industry, which includes a publishing arm of over 20 e-guides on MBA admissions that clients can purchase.  Founder, Stacy Blackman, is also a frequent blogger and contributor for “Strictly Business” for U.S. News, Wharton Blog Network, and Business Insider.  

### **Hiring and Consultant Training**
SBC requires prospective admissions consultants to demonstrate their skills by editing sample essays and submitting writing samples.  Once hired, consultants can expect to attend regular all-hands calls as part of their ongoing training.  They have access to an internal database tracking school-specific resources and individuals who are school experts are responsible for updating their respective school guides that the company sells.  

SBC regularly attend conferences with fellow admissions consultants and meet with admissions committees to understand changes in their policies.  For example, Stanford recently hired a new Director of Admissions and several of the SBC consultants met with her to understand where she wants to take the direction of the school’s admission strategy.  

### **Consulting Process**

SBC consultants work both full-time and part-time for the company.  They don’t disclose the number of clients that consultants typically work with, but they also “don’t think that clients should care as long as their consultant is responsive and delivering”.  

SBC has a multi-tiered application review process.  You will work with one consultant as your primary point of contact, but you will also have access to a client liaison as a secondary person you can reach out to for brainstorming ideas or essay reviews.  You also have access to what the company calls an “Extra Eyes” review to get a different read on your application by a relevant expert.  Lastly, SBC allows clients to “Flight Test” their draft application and send it to a former admissions director for review; the test is meant to serve as a dress rehearsal before final submission.  He/she will rate the application and highlight your strengths and weaknesses as they would be perceived by the admissions committee.  You will then work with your primary consultant to incorporate the feedback.  

SBC prides itself on its comprehensive admissions consulting services.  Consultants are trained in resume review and figuring out what needs to be cut and patterns of behavior that admissions directors look for.  They will then utilize your recommenders to address your different areas of weakness.  They utilize video software so applicants can practice different types of interviews, including those done at Kellogg (video) and Wharton (group). 

You have the option of purchasing their all-in package, which is their comprehensive admissions consulting package.  Or you can hire a consultant through their hourly services.  You can roll up to three hours of a la carte pricing into the purchase of an all-in package if you want to test them out first. 

### **Consultant Selection**

One of the principals of the company manages the client matching process.  She has applicants complete a questionnaire on their background and then based on profile fit, schools you’re applying to, and consultant availability she will match you.  You will be given the consultants background in advance to review.  You can decide if you’re satisfied with the selection or if you would like someone else. Unlike most other consulting firms, Stacy Blackman does not provide a comprehensive list of their consultants on their website.

### **Heard from a former SBC Consultant**

“The main point of differentiation with SBC’s services is they have a former admissions leader review applications before submission via the “Flight Test”.  Otherwise I didn’t see a real difference in services that SBC offered compared to other companies.”

### **Our 30-Minute free consultation experience**

•	Submitted brief online questionnaire and then heard back from principal of the company that same day to setup a call or Skype session.

•	Company principal seemed surprised at even general company/industry questions and was not forthright with answers.  

•	Although call went much longer than the 30-minute time allotment, I did not feel like my questions were all answered as principal did so indirectly and without much transparency. 

•	Insights given by the consultant felt fairly “boiler plate” in nature and not as nuanced or personalized to my background as I had received from other firms

•	I did not receive any personal followup from the call other than generic emails from the company as being a part of their listserv.  Here are some of the resources that SBC sent out: 

          •	Client case studies

          •	Article on choosing the right MBA program

          •	SBC’s comprehensive process


### **Points of Pride**

• One of the first admissions consulting firms in the business

•	Preferred admissions consultant by The Economist

•	Claims to have the highest number of online reviews for their industry, although could not verify this

•	Founder Stacy Blackman is a frequent blogger and requested speaker on MBA admissions and is the co-author of The MBA Application Roadmap
