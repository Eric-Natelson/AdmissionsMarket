### **Overview**
ARINGO’s founder launched the company nearly 15 years ago and boasts in his bio that he was admitted to Harvard, Wharton, and INSEAD with a GMAT of 650.  Similarly, ARINGO’s current president promotes the fact that he gained admissions to LBS with a GMAT of only 620.  ARINGO claims to be the firm to work with if you are a student looking to bridge the gap between a low GMAT score, low GPA or little work experience and still gain admission to a top-10 MBA program.  

### **Hiring and Consultant Training**
The company primarily hires team members with previous admissions consulting or committee experience so they focus trainings on ARINGO-specific processes.  When hiring new consultants they look at previous education, how active they were on campus, writing and editing skills, and creativity.  

ARINGO relies on a market and research team to keep the rest of the consultants informed on industry changes.  The team stays abreast of all school/essay changes by attending MBA events, reading school blogs, following MBA-focused websites like Poets & Quants and BusinessInsider, and staying active in their respective alumni networks.  ARINGO also interviews MBA admissions officers from time to time in order to stay in the loop with industry changes and to prove they are respected in the industry.  For instance, they recently shared a Q&A on their blog with the Director of Admissions at the Kellogg School of Management.

### **Consulting Process**

ARINGO hires two different types of consultants: Senior Application Consultants and Senior MBA Consultants.  The former (Application consultants) is an experienced consultant with a Masters degree other than in business.  They are typically writers, editors or higher education professionals.  They take on a maximum of five clients at a time.  The latter (MBA consultant) serves as an insider consultant who typically graduated from a top MBA program .Senior MBA Consultants typically work with 1-3 applicants at a time.  
Regardless of who your primary consultant is you will also have access to other members of the consulting team to review your application.  ARINGO brings in a fresh consultant to look over every application as part of their comprehensive service.  The comprehensive service also helps with narrowing down school choice, fulfilling all aspects of application requirements, interview practice, decision-making once you get in, waitlist assistance and ding support.  They claim you will be given unlimited access to your consultant with no limit to phone calls.  ARINGO consultants are available evenings and weekends for phone calls and Skype sessions.

### **Consultant Selection**

You will be given a recommendation on which consultant to work with by the management team, but you ultimately get to decide.  ARINGO states that they take time on the frontend pairing you with the “correct” consultant, but their matching process is unclear. 

Typically you will work with one of the Senior MBA Consultants as your primary point of contact; they will be focused on content and ensuring your essay answers are on point.  Then they will turn over your essays to a Senior Application Consultant once they are about 80% complete who will focus on writing mechanics.  You can also opt to do the reverse and work with someone from the experienced team as your primary point of contact.  They promote the fact that you are always be able to get a second opinion as part of your consulting package, that said it is unclear how often a member of the same firm would go against the recommendation of a colleague even if they disagreed.
