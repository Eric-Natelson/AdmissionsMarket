The GMAT is a computer adaptive test that assesses a student’s analytical, writing, quantitative, verbal, and reading skills. The results are then used in determining a student’s admissions decision to a graduate management program, such as an MBA.

Here, Craig answers 20 of the most commonly asked GMAT questions.

##**1) What is a good GMAT score?**##

Get ready for a phrase you’ll hear often in the MBA: “it depends”. You’ll want a score that’s near or ideally above the average for the schools you’re looking at, and top 10 programs all have average GMAT scores above 700. However, your score will be evaluated alongside your resume and admissions essays. The stronger the latter two, the more GMAT leeway you’ll have: remember that a lower-than-average score won’t disqualify you.

**##2)	But what about the IR and AWA sections? How important are those?##**

There is nothing unimportant in your application, and these sections shouldn’t be taken lightly. However, they should take second priority to the Quant and Verbal sections. Average GMAT scores (the traditional 200-800 Quant and Verbal score) influence a school’s ranking, so they are under more scrutiny by the admissions committee. You don’t need a great IR/AWA score to get into a top school, but a bad score can hurt your profile.

**##3)	How much time should I spend studying for the GMAT?##**

Here it is again: “it depends.” The closer you are initially to your goal score, the less studying you’ll have ahead of you. Most clients I have worked with study for 3-6 months. Study hours are positively correlated with GMAT score, and the average study hours of 700+ exam takers is 121.

**##4)	How should I study – self-study, in a course, or with a 1:1 tutor?##**

Some students solely self-study, others use a tutor from start-to-finish, while still others may mix-and-match methods. Some of the advantages and disadvantages of each are shown below to guide your decision.

**##Self Study##**
Advantages: Lowest investment
Disadvantages: For some students, can be a lower score “return” per hours studied 

Course
Advantages: More economical thatn 1:1 tutoring, can be a helpful concept review if at your pace, resgular schedule can help study routine
Disadvantage: Course can be too slow/too fast for you as an individual, can be difficult to correct individual habits in a course environment, can put too much emphasis on concepts over strategy

**##1:1 tutoring##**
Advantages: Helps you get more effective use of your own study hours; a good tutor moves at your pace to optimize learning; helps motivate you with individual accountability; every hour you spend can be on the content/strategy area you need most
Disadvantages: Greatest investment

5)	How can I find a good GMAT tutor?

A good GMAT tutor will have proven results and extensive experience, but importantly, will also give you a good feeling when you work together and explain things in a way that makes sense to you. Trust your intuition!

6)	There are a lot of different GMAT books. What book should I use to study for the GMAT?

Generally, you’ll want two things from your GMAT books:
1)	Relevant GMAT practice questions
2)	Explanations of key GMAT concepts
The “Official Guide” is a great resource for point 1. To cover point 2, go for a book by a reputable GMAT preparation company – most will have all the concepts you’ll need.

7)	How can I get started?

Once you have a general idea of the exam format and your books in-hand, take a practice test to gauge your score (there are two practice exams on mba.com, the makers of the GMAT, and a variety of free and paid practice exams online). Check what concepts you’re regularly making errors on and look to refresh those areas first. It’s also important to get into a good study routine. Make your study time consistent and sustainable – the GMAT is a marathon, not a sprint.

8)	How do I manage my time on the GMAT?

There are 37 quant questions and 41 verbal questions; each exam takes 75 minutes. That means roughly 2 minutes per question (you see, GMAT-style math really is valuable in everyday life!). But some questions take more time, some less. Check your progress in regular intervals, after every 5 questions for example. If you are behind, best to guess on the next difficult question and make time up. 

9)	What is a productive way to use practice tests in my studying?

Please don’t torture yourself and take a practice exam every day for the next month (sounds silly, but there are those out there who do!) Rather, take one at regular intervals, every two to three weeks for example, to gauge your progress. And “squeeze the juice” out of each one as a study tool: Do a thorough review of your missed questions. Why did you miss it? What should you do in your studying as a result? Can you explain the problem clearly to a friend now? If you can, you know you’ve got it.

10)	I’m not sure if my GMAT score is high enough. Should I retake it?

It depends (if that answer makes you want to throw something at your screen 10 questions into this blog, try holding it together when a classmate says these words a year into your MBA!) Refreshingly, the average score improvement from a re-taken exam is 30 points, but it’s important to ask yourself a couple of questions: Will you realistically improve? What will you do differently in your studying to reach that higher score?  If you haven’t used a tutor, sometimes that can help unlock your full potential.
