So, you’re considering a GMAT tutor… congrats! A good one can make a triple-digit score or double-digit percentile GMAT jump possible on your B-School application. However, you may still be thinking – why get a tutor when there are so many other less expensive options out there? Well, the difference between getting a personal tutor and watching free videos online, buying a couple of prep books for yourself, or joining an in-person class is like the difference between watching free yoga videos online, buying a yoga mat for yourself, joining a yoga class, or engaging a yogi for personal instruction. All things equal, everyone would choose the yogi, right!?


As a long-time test-prep tutor, I cannot tell you how many times students have come to me after spending (wasting?) money on one of the other non-tutoring test-prep options, and I’ve had to say how much I wished they’d saved that time and effort by seeking personalized instruction straightaway. Not only is a tutor best suited to provide personalized instruction, but a tutor can also keep you from perpetuating bad habits and wasting money on techniques that might not work for you personally. Of course, not all tutors are created equal, so here are five questions, that you should prepare for any potential tutors to gauge whether they would be a good fit for your GMAT needs.


#### **How long have you been specifically tutoring the GMAT?**

Experience is the best teacher, and you should find a tutor who has spent a lot of time teaching the GMAT. Many tutors market themselves as test-prep instructors and will say that they can tutor any grad school entrance exam. **Make sure your potential instructor has significant GMAT-specific tutoring experience** and not just a generic test-prep background or experience teaching in a classroom environment. While there is some crossover across the grad school exams, I for one definitely utilize some LSAT stylings in my Critical Reasoning instruction, the GMAT is unique and you should want someone with the experience to demonstrate knowledge of all sections and question types inside and out. Additionally, one-on-one instruction is very different than teaching from a textbook in class so you should **seek a tutor who is experienced in providing personalized instruction.**


#### **Where did you go to college and what was your major?**

Your goal is to get into a good school, so you should be interested in where your instructor went for his or her degrees. I’m not saying you must demand Ivy League credentials if you are targeting HBS, nor that someone with a B.S. from Beloit is unqualified, but **your instructor should be willing to share and explain his or her own educational experience**. If the tutor is hesitant to share this background info, it could be an indication that some other parts of their resume might be shady. Also, finding out your instructor’s academic bona fides is a quick way to help decide if you two will be a personality match. You’re going to be spending a lot of time together while prepping, so it’s important to find someone with similar interests who you can get along with!


#### **What is your favorite GMAT section to teach?**

No matter what a parent might tell you, everyone has a favorite even amongst their kids. That doesn’t mean you love the others any less, it just means that you’re human and have personal preferences! As a consequence of my Northwestern University journalism degree, I personally love teaching the unloved Sentence Corrections more than anything. I enjoy the challenge of trying to convince students (futilely?) that they can be fun. That doesn’t mean that I don’t enjoy sharing tips and tricks for the other sections, it just means that there is a twinkle in my eye when I get to talk smack about why idiom memorization doesn’t matter nearly as much as you might have thought it would. In addition, **the answer to this question can help you determine how much experience a potential instructor has**. If the prospective instructor can explain his or her favorite section with panache, then this is probably a tutor with a decent amount of experience. If not, it could be a red flag that the candidate might not be as familiar with the exam as you’d like.


#### **What was your GMAT score?**

Now, we’re getting to the good stuff, right? You should want your instructor to be able to share a solid score in at least the 90th percentile/700+ range. However, you shouldn’t make score the sole factor for your decision and that’s why it is a bit further down this list than you may have expected. A savant does not necessarily make a good instructor. After all **your tutor doesn’t take the test for you, he or she explains the test for you**. A GMAT phenom with a 790 official score report might seem like an ideal tutor, but if you yourself are currently struggling to get out of the 500s, the phenom may not be able to exhibit the patience and communication skills necessary to help you reach your GMAT potential.


#### **Which schools have accepted your former students?**

We’ve all heard that past performance does not guarantee future results, and as a GMAT tutor I remind prospective students of this regularly. Just because I’ve had students get 750+ on the GMAT doesn’t mean you will. So, why does every prospective student ask me what kind of scores other students have gotten? A much better question to ask your prospective tutor, is which schools have accepted your students? By the time you’ve begun considering tutors, you should have a good idea of which business schools you want to attend. **If your prospective tutor has alumni in your target programs, then that tutor might be able to get you in too**.
