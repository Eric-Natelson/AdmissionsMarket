The process of applying to business school is full of question marks. Are my scores good enough to get into my dream school?
How much does my undergraduate GPA really matter? Do I have enough real-world experience to wow admissions committees? The
perplexing nature of applicant questions like these resulted in the birth of the admissions consulting industry.

As you might expect, not all consultants are created equal. As a whole they vary greatly in terms of expertise; some are former
admissions officers, others are industry execs or come from long careers in academia or publishing, or they could be recent
graduates of a top business school. Admissions consultants might work at a large 100+ person company or represent a boutique
firm of one. They offer a myriad of services from strategy and brainstorming sessions to help mine your unique strengths, to
creating a customized action plan for each of your apps, to refining essays and offering resume reviews.

Given that a reported <a href="http://aigac.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AIGAC-2013-Prospect-Survey-Report-6-12-13-presentation.pdf">57% of MBA applicants used an admissions consultant</a>, partnering with a consultant can give you the necessary
competitive edge in an already hyper competitive market. In addition to gaining highly individualized feedback on your candidacy,
you’ll also benefit from a company’s collective knowledge and expertise whose sole goal should be to make you the most competitive
applicant possible. These are people who eat, sleep, and breathe business school admissions, and they are committed to working alongside
applicants to get them into their dream school. <a href="http://poetsandquants.com/2017/04/12/acceptance-rates-top-50-mba-programs/">With acceptance rates to top 10 business schools hovering at just 14.5% in 2016</a>, it’s no
wonder that admissions consultants have become so indispensable. Still, with quality varying so dramatically, it’s critical that you
choose the right one.
