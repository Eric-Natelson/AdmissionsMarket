### **Overview**
Two MBA students at Yale entered their school’s business plan competition in 2001 to create a superior GMAT test prep course than what was currently being offered in the market.  They won and Veritas Prep was born.  Building on their laudable success in the test prep space, they further expanded the business to include admissions consulting.  Veritas Prep’s one-stop shop with expertise in both GMAT prep and admissions consulting is now the largest privately held firm like it in the United States.   

### **Hiring and Consultant Training**
Veritas Prep recruits consultants with formal evaluative admissions experience from top MBA programs.  In addition to having admissions experience whether as an admissions officer, application reader, or interviewer, the large majority of their Head Consultants received a degree from a top MBA program.  Veritas Prep requires that their consultants maintain relationships with their respective MBA programs so they are kept in the loop about school developments and many continue to serve at their alma maters as alumni interviewers.  As a result of the admissions experience that consultants bring with them, the firm claims there is very little formal training needed.  Instead, onboarding consists primarily of teaching consultants on Veritas Prep’s internal processes and interpreting the results of the Myers-Briggs tests they give to both consultants and clients.  

Veritas Prep maintains membership and attends AIGAC’s annual conference along with admissions officers from MBA programs around the world.  Veritas Prep leadership who attend the conference are able to gain insights into changes and priorities at business schools.  

### **Consulting Process**
Veritas Prep employs over 100 part-time admissions consultants.  Given the large staff, Veritas Prep asserts that it is able to maintain an average ratio of client to consultant at 4:1. That said, don’t be fooled by the law of averages as given the large number of consultants, it’s highly possible that specific consultants take on far more than four consultants.  

If you purchase one of Veritas Prep’s school packages, you will follow a three-tier consultative and evaluative process, which is meant to mirror how the admissions committee will review your application:

1.	Head Consultant—he/she helps to make sure your application stands out and put your best foot forward
2.	School Specialist—ensures you are a strong fit for the specific school you are applying
3.	Ultimately a former admissions director or assistant director will review your application to predict how you will be evaluated

You will be assigned a Head Consultant who you’ll work with throughout the application process.  In addition to the insights of your Head Consultant, you’ll also work with a School Specialist from each MBA program where you’re applying.  As applicants need to prove a strong personal and cultural fit for each school they apply, Veritas Prep believes that working with a recent alumnus of the school will give you a competitive edge.  The idea is to gain his/her perspective on school culture in order to add relevance to your application.  

Provided your application is completed within two weeks of the school deadline it will be reviewed by someone in the Ultimate Admissions Committee.  He/she will provide an analysis of how they think your application will be reviewed so you can make any final changes.   

### **Consultant Selection**
Veritas Prep takes consultant matching to a whole new level.  You’re matched with a Head Consultant based on your background, goals, and your Myers Briggs test results.  They guarantee a great consultant match but if after seven days you’re not fully satisfied they will pair you with a new consultant or you can get your money back. 

They’ve also partnered with Myers Briggs to create a unique personality assessment specifically geared for business school applications called the Personalized MBA Game Plan.  The test results are meant to feature your personality strengths along the same spectrum that admissions officers look for in successful applicants.  The test results are also supposed to tease out your weaknesses so you can address this in your application, provide brainstorming ideas from your background to include in your essays, and highlight the type of environment where you thrive so you can ensure you’re applying to schools that are your best fit.
