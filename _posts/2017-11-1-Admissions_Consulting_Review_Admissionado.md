### **Overview**
One of the newer major players in the admissions consulting space, Admissionado, provides consulting services to both MBA and undergraduate applicants.  Two former classmates from Brown University founded the company in 2007, and today employ a collective total of 100 part-time consultants working remotely and full-time staff from their headquarters in Chicago.  Current consultants call the place “a hip cool culture” with consultants that are “fun and easy to talk to.” We tend to agree! 

### **Hiring and Consultant Training**
Admissionado takes the hiring process quite seriously (indeed, the consultant who we spoke with said it was one of the most difficult recruiting experiences she’s ever been through) and the process takes several weeks.  Besides interviewing consultants to ensure they will be a good fit culturally, they are asked to take a skills test and then are given real resumes and essays to edit and provide feedback on in real time.  The company boasts that they only hire 5% of all consultant applicants. 

As consultants work virtually around the country, leadership conducts regular trainings over Skype.  Headquarters also sends out monthly emails to consultants with blog posts on relevant school changes and articles with particular insights on admissions consulting.  

The company has an extensive knowledge bank of internal resources that are maintained by seasoned admissions consultants and that are readily available to all consultants.  The company also maintains listservs for consultants to contact each other on based on areas of expertise or specialties (ex. specific schools, business sectors etc.).  Since Admissionado’s consultants all have full-time jobs across multiple industries, they frequently utilize each other’s collective knowledge.  If, for example, an applicant has aspirations to break into a specific sector that the consultant doesn’t directly work in then he/she need only to send out a message through the listserv to find a colleague who does.  

### **Consulting Process**

Admissionado’s 37 consultants are spread all over the country.  They work part-time for the company and maintain their own professional careers, taking on four to six clients a year.  The firm encourages its consultants to have separate careers from consulting, as it believes it gives them a broader perspective since they are directly connected to the industries they serve.  

Admissionado’s consulting process structure is the following:

1.	Senior Consultant (main point of contact) – The Senior Consultant graduated from a top-MBA program and serves as the key strategist for your application.  He/she helps position your candidacy in the best way possible.
2.	Editor – These non-MBAs are highly trained in journalism or publishing and will be dissecting and providing feedback on your resume and essays.  Your Senior Consultant will remain your point of contact in the editing stage so you don’t have to deal with a new person. 
3.	Headquarters Staff – They will be in contact with you directly to take care of any logistics, billing or scheduling so consultants can focus exclusively on their application expertise.  

The consulting process starts with a discovery call with the Head Consultant, which serves as a very in-depth brainstorming call.  It’s a very dig deep call—reviewing your strengths and weaknesses—but the point is to position you strategically and try to tease out the stories that will be used in your essays.  

Applicants have the option to choose between a Junior Deluxe and Deluxe package.  The former is for those who mostly just need essay support and don’t need resume review or interview prep and the latter is the more traditional soup to nuts package with full application support including assistance with letters of recommendation.  (Applicants can always opt to start with a Junior Deluxe package and add on resume review or interview prep a la carte at a later date.) 

Regardless of the package chosen, the consulting process always begins with this initial Discovery Call.  The biggest distinction though is if you opt for the Junior Deluxe package you will only have access to your consultant by email going forward.  Email response time is promised within 24 hours—including weekends—so you’ll still hear from your consultant regularly. 

Ultimately, Admissionado’s unique pricing mechanisms makes them the only major consulting firm with a flexible, applicant-friendly payment scheme that allows people of all budgets to feel like they’re getting excellent value.

### **Consultant Selection**

After completing a long series of profile questions—some serious and some on the more whimsical side that are meant to get at the heart of what drives you—applicants are matched with a Head Consultant.  You also have the option of requesting a particular consultant and will be matched with him/her based on availability.  

### **Our 30-Minute free consultation experience**

• Following submission of the profile questions, I received an automated email response from Director of Operations with a welcome PDF and a promise that I would hear back within 24 hours on next steps. Within 12 hours I heard from her again with an introduction to a Senior Consultant whose background closely matched my aspirational post-MBA background.

• The Consultant then sent me an email 20 minutes later introducing herself and proposing either a call or a video chat over Skype in the next week.  All of this quick communication took place over the weekend.

• For our call together, the consultant gave a quick overview of her background, provided clear, direct feedback on areas to focus on for my application, and still left ample time for my questions. 

• The Director of Operations shared the following resources:

• Link to their [2016-2017 Essay Analyses](http://admissionado.com/resources/essay-analysis/?utm_medium=email&utm_content=four&utm_campaign=mba_post_fc&utm_source=Admissionado+Master+List&utm_campaign=5208cfef04-&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_a8ca47cb10-5208cfef04-143954981) broken down by 21 different schools

• The call was very informative; the consultant wasn’t afraid to provide helpful feedback on my application, and was also quick to answer any questions and/or concerns as I raised them, quickly building trust through friendliness and transparency
